# Weather-Activity-Recommender-Bot-Final-Project
A Python-based weather bot that fetches real-time weather data for any city and suggests what you can do (or wear) based on the conditions.

The Weather Activity Recommender Bot is a Python program that helps the user quickly check the weather in their city and get personalized suggestions for what to do (or wear) based on current the conditions. Instead of just showing raw weather data, this bot makes the information more practical and fun by providing activity recommendations tailored to the temperature and weather type.

This project combines real-time data from the Weatherstack API with a simple recommendation system that makes it easier to plan your day. Whether itâ€™s hot, warm, chilly, or freezing outside, the bot has a suggestion ready for you.
